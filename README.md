# RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout-Program-VSD
This repository contains my learnings, notes, and resources from the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program, a nation-wide initiative under the "Chips to Startup (C2S)" programme by the Ministry of Electronics &amp; IT (MeitY), Govt. of India.  The program focuses in VLSI, Semiconductor Design, and RISC-V based SoCs â€“ from Concept to Silicon (C2S).
