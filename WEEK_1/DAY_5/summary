Using Creative Commons Licenses

CC licenses provide standard terms that creators can use to share their work legally. Here are some key points:

For Creators (Licensors):

Ensure you have the rights to license the work.

Clearly mark any parts of the work that are not covered by the license.

The license is irrevocable, so once applied, it cannot be withdrawn.

Consider reading CC’s guidance on licensing for more details: Considerations for licensors

For the Public (Users):

You may use the work under the conditions set by the license.

If the work is free to use under copyright exceptions (like fair use), the license does not restrict that use.

Respect any additional requests by the creator, such as marking modifications.

Key Terms

Adapted Material: Any work that is based on the original work and includes changes like translation, alteration, or remixing.

Licensed Material: The original work under CC BY 4.0.

Licensed Rights: Rights granted to use the work according to the license, including copying, sharing, and creating adaptations.

Licensor: The person or entity who applied the CC license.

Share: Make the work available publicly by any means, including online or offline.

Scope of the License

License Grant: You are free to copy, distribute, and adapt the work globally, without paying royalties, as long as you follow the license conditions.

No Endorsement: Using the work does not imply that the creator endorses you or your use.

Other Rights: The license does not grant moral rights, patents, or trademarks.

License Conditions

Attribution Required: You must give proper credit, indicate changes if any, and provide a link to the license.

You may meet these requirements in any reasonable way, depending on the medium or format.

Downstream Users: Recipients of the licensed material automatically have the same rights under CC BY 4.0.

Database Rights

If you use a database covered by CC BY 4.0, you may extract and reuse substantial parts of its contents.

If you adapt the database itself, the new database is considered “Adapted Material.”

Warranties and Liability

The work is provided as-is, without any warranties of accuracy, quality, or suitability.

The licensor is not liable for any damages or losses from using the work.

Termination

If you fail to follow the license, your rights terminate automatically.

Rights can be reinstated if violations are corrected within 30 days or by express permission from the licensor.

Other Notes

CC BY 4.0 does not restrict any legal uses that do not require permission.

If part of the license is unenforceable, the remaining terms still apply.

No part of this license should be interpreted as giving legal advice.

In short: CC BY 4.0 allows anyone to use, share, and adapt a work as long as they give proper credit, indicate changes, and include the license details.
