Week 3 Task – Post-Synthesis GLS & STA Fundamentals
Part 2 – Fundamentals of Static Timing Analysis (STA)
Objective

To understand the basic principles of Static Timing Analysis (STA) and how it helps ensure that a digital circuit meets timing requirements under all conditions, without requiring exhaustive simulations.

Key Concepts Learned from the STA Course
1. What is STA?

Static Timing Analysis (STA) is a method to verify the timing performance of a digital circuit without applying any input vectors.

It checks whether all timing paths meet the setup and hold requirements for reliable operation.

STA ensures that signals reach their destinations at the right time for proper synchronization.

2. Setup Time & Hold Time

Setup Time:
The minimum time before the clock edge during which data must remain stable to be correctly captured by a flip-flop.

Hold Time:
The minimum time after the clock edge during which data must remain stable.

Violations:

Setup violation: Data arrives too late → may cause wrong data capture.

Hold violation: Data changes too early → may overwrite previous data.

3. Timing Paths

Every path in a circuit can be categorized as:

Launch path: Where data starts (from a register or input).

Capture path: Where data ends (to a register or output).

STA analyzes all such combinational paths between start and end points.

4. Clock Definitions

The clock signal is the timing reference for synchronization across registers.

STA requires defining:

Clock period (defines max operating frequency).

Clock source & propagation delay.

Clock uncertainty or jitter.

Proper clock definition ensures accurate setup/hold time checks across domains.

5. Slack

Slack = Required Time – Arrival Time

Positive Slack: Timing met (data arrives early enough).

Negative Slack: Timing violation (data arrives too late).

STA tools like OpenSTA highlight paths with the worst negative slack (WNS) — the critical paths limiting performance.

6. Path-Based Analysis

STA tools compute delays across all possible paths and identify the critical path (longest delay).

Path-based analysis helps pinpoint which logic elements or interconnects cause timing issues.

Engineers can optimize these paths through re-synthesis, buffering, or clock skew adjustments.

7. Importance of STA

Ensures the circuit runs correctly at the target frequency.

Detects timing issues early, saving simulation time.

Provides reports like setup slack, hold slack, and timing paths, essential for sign-off.

Summary
STA is a vectorless, timing-based verification method that ensures the digital design meets timing constraints.
It focuses on setup and hold checks, clock definitions, and path-based analysis, with slack serving as the key metric for timing health.
