Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning

Basic Terms
Tapeout - Final IC design is completed and sent to fabrication. Si-Proven - After fabrication, if the chip works as expected, it is called Silicon Proven (Si-Proven). Unproven Silicon - Only verified in simulations, not fabricated yet. synthesis - To convert to gates

Applications of SoC
Examples of application which run on this chip : PPT, Excel, Zoom, Firefox. End goal: A particular application should run on this chip.

Chip Modeling (Design flow)
Example :Taking an example Processor Design (Heart of any Device – Laptop/Mobile)

BLOCK 1: Write code in any language → Compile using GCC in Linux.--------------------->(O0)

BLOCK 2:Processor follows specifications → Tested using a testbench (in C).---------->(O1) -------->Checking (O0==O1)

BLOCK 3:Verilog (Sofy copy of hardware using RTL )----------------------------------->(O2) -------->Checking (O1==O2)

BLOCK 4: Specs written
Convert into design modules (processor + peripherals + IPs). ASIC synthesis: Processor (synthesizable). Memory (synthesizable). Peripherals (synthesizable). Analog IP (not synthesizable, needs custom design).

ASIC Engineer- Takes all blocks plugs the way in which it has to be .Connect SOC to GPIOs->(O3)------>Checking(O2==O3)

Floor palnning,Placement, cts,routing

Final design is converted into GDSII format (layout data)

DRC/LVS checks before fabrication.(GDS goes to DRC/LVS) Once specs are fixed -> Chip design is frozen -> Sent for tapeout.

Industries return chip back-> Tape in

Test bench in C to peripherals----------------------------------------------------------->(04)--->Checking(O3==O4)

Design Completed (O0==O1==O2==O3==O4)

Final chip speed ( Process works for) : ~100 MHz to 130 MHz.

End Applications of Fabricated Chips
Smartwatch Arduino board TV panel Any custom application
